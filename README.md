==============

`nark-fsa` is a Finite State Automata library, it is private on github, it provides:
* High compression dictionary with hierachical keys
* DAWG(Directed Acyclic Word Graph)
* Multiple Regular Expression matching
* Aho-Corasick automata

<h2 id="adfa">High compression dictionary with hierachical keys</h2>
### Features
  1. Fast
  1. Small: much smaller than input data set
  1. prefix search: search keys which is a prefix of input text
  1. predictive search: search suffixies which prefixies matche input text
  1. value search: value search is a kind of predictive search

There are two implementation of Aho-Corasick automata: Compact Dynamic DFA based and double array trie based.
